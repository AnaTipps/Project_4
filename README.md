Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately detect breast cancer based on the morphology of cells in breast tissue samples. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. By analyzing cell morphology, we can create a tool that assists medical professionals in identifying potential cases of breast cancer more accurately and quickly.
Five machine learning models will be compared to identify the one that performs best in predicting breast cancer diagnosis: which include:
Random Forest Classification
Decision Tree Algorithm
Logistic Regression
Support vector machines
Neural Networks

Tools and Technologies:
For this project, we will primarily use the following tools and technologies:
Scikit-learn: We will leverage Scikit-learn, a powerful machine learning library in Python, for building and evaluating our machine learning models.
Python Pandas: Pandas will be used for data preprocessing and manipulation, making it easier to prepare the dataset for machine learning.
Python Matplotlib: Matplotlib will help in creating data visualizations and plots to better understand the data and present our findings. We will be comparing the efficiency of the Machine Learning models.
Tableau: To visualize the morphology of the cells,, to create a dashboard.

PROJECT STRATEGY:

1. Data Collection:
   Obtain a dataset of breast tissue samples with associated features related to cell morphology, using publicly available datasets like the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer, WBCD), which is commonly used for such tasks.
2. Data Preprocessing:
   Use Python Pandas to load and preprocess the dataset. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if necessary, and scaling features for consistency.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Utilize Tableau and Python pandas to visualize the dataset. Explore statistics, distributions, and correlations between features. EDA will help in gaining insights into the data and understanding which features are relevant for breast cancer detection.

5. Machine Learning (Model, Fit, Predict):
   Select appropriate machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn for classification. Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks and Decision Tree) are good candidates for binary classification tasks like this.
   Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   Train multiple models and compare their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. Model Performance Evaluation and Comparison:
   Fine-tune hyperparameter
   Evaluate the model on the test set to measure its real-world performance.
7. Visualization and Reporting:
   Use Python Matplotlib and Tableau to create visualizations that showcase the model's performance.
8. Documentation:
   Document the entire project, including data sources, data preprocessing steps, model selection, and deployment process using Github and Readme files.

   RESEARCH QUESTION: Which model,among the array of supervised learning algorithms assessed in this study demonstrates the highest effectiveness in precisely distinguishing between malignant and benign breast cancer?
